> Introduce the dataset<br>This dataset is financial dataset and this is related to the loan, borrowers, lenders, interest rates and stuffs like that. Prosper or Prosper Marketplace Inc. is a San Francisco, California based company specializing in loans at low interest rates to the borrowers. In this dataset, we are using the data from the Posper to analyse it and trying to find the pattern in the Prosper data.<br>The dataset can be found <a href='https://s3.amazonaws.com/udacity-hosted-downloads/ud651/prosperLoanData.csv' >here</a>, with feature documentation available <a href='https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gDyi_L4UvIrLTEC6Wri5nbaMmkGmLQBk-Yx3z0XDEtI/edit#gid=0'>here</a>.<br>The dataset is comprised of 81 variables and contains 113937 entries. The variable that are explored in the dataset are mentioned below.


## Summary of Findings
<hr>

> This exploratory data analysis paved the way for some interesting and surprising insights. Below are some of my findings:<br> - Original Loan Amounts are mostly distributed between 0 to 15000 dollars.<br>- Loans are mostly requested for in the First and Fourth Quarter of the year presumingly to implement new year plans and/or enjoy the holidays.<br>- Debt consolidation is the single most important stated reason for loans with just over 50%.<br>- Carlifornia state is where most loans originates from with 14%. <br>- The more monthly income that people have, the higher the amount of loan they will receive or access...thus monthly income positively correlates with loan amount. <br>- Interest rates have been falling from 2011 at just above 22% to just below 16% in 2014. <br>- Expensive (higher amount) loans does not mean higher interest rates, it is the same for annual costs of loans (Borrower APR).<br>- Low-income earners are mostly the 'high risk loan' borrowers. <br>- As original loan amount increases, so too the monthly payment of loans.


## Key Insights for Presentation
<hr>

> For this explanatory report, I have decided to select the following key insights to try to answer my main question of Why Prosper Inc. Provides Better Loans for Borrowers?:<br>- Carlifornia state is where most loans originates from with 14% <br>- Interest rates have been falling from 2011 at just above 22% to just below 16% in 2014 <br>- Expensive (higher amount) loans does not mean higher interest rates, it is the same for annual costs of loans (Borrower APR). <br>- Debt consolidattion is the single most important stated reason for loans usage with just over 50%. <br>- The more monthly income that people have, the higher the amount of loan they will receive or access...thus monthly income positively correlates with loan amount. <br> Overall, it is shown that interest rate or annual borrower cost of loan (Borrower APR) are very favorable and decrease as you access higher amount of loan. A key insight to point at is also interest rate has been falling from 22% in 2011 to 16% in 2014 which is great news for borrowers as they can get better deals.
